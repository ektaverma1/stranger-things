As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.\"",
        "Despite the fact that none of the series was filmed in Durham or North Carolina (it was filmed in Georgia), a ton of references to the region are hidden in the show."
